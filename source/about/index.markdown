I had been carrying around a text file for some 10 years and every time I heard a great software related quote I'd add it to the end of the file. The file got relatively big and had quite a lot of quotes in it and I thought I could turn it into a website to make it easy to discover and share these quotes for myself and others, and so this website was born. This is by no means an exhaustive list of all great quotes about software development but rather those I find interesting and influential or funny. 

The source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/MehdiK/software-quotes). So if you find any issues or mistakes or if you would like to contribute an awesome quote either raise an issue on GitHub or even better send me a pull request.

I hope you find this useful.
