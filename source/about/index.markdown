I carried around a text file for quite a few years and every time I heard a great software related quote I'd add it to the file. The file got relatively big so I thought I could turn it into a website to make it easy to discover and share these quotes for myself and others, and so this website was born. 

This is by no means an exhaustive list of all quotes about software development but rather those I find interesting and influential or funny. 

The source code of this blog, which is based on Octopress, is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/MehdiK/software-quotes). If you find any issues or mistakes or if you would like to contribute an awesome quote either raise an issue on GitHub or even better send me a pull request.

I hope you find this useful.
